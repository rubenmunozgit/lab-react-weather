# Yes! aanother Weather react app
You will find another weather react app build with `create-react-app` script.

I try to walk throught on all features that this wheather app has.
Please check the real thing: https://rubenmunozgit.github.io/lab-react-weather/

- First the weather api is from: www.openweather.com
- It will give you information regarding the current conditions and a forecast by days.
- It gets the weather information based on the Browser Navigation.
- I tried to build all css, no bootstraping or similar (please don't judge ;) ).
